# USGS Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

## Overview

This repository showcases a visualization tool for earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and tectonic plate boundary data. The project is structured in two parts, focusing on visual representation of seismic activity and the correlation between earthquakes and tectonic plate boundaries.

## Contents

### Leaflet-Part-1
- `index.html`: HTML file rendering the initial earthquake data visualization.
- `static/css/style.css`: CSS styles for the map visualization.
- `static/js/logic.js`: JavaScript logic for fetching, processing, and visualizing earthquake data on the map.

### Leaflet-Part-2
- `index.html`: HTML file rendering the advanced visualization including tectonic plates.
- `static/css/style.css`: CSS styles for the enhanced map visualization.
- `static/js/logic.js`: JavaScript logic for integrating and visualizing both earthquake and tectonic plate data.

## Objectives

### Earthquake Visualization (Leaflet-Part-1)
- Visualization of real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
- Use of markers to represent earthquake magnitude and depth.
- Implementation of a map legend for interpreting the markers.

### Tectonic Plate Visualization (Leaflet-Part-2)
- Integration of tectonic plate boundary data on the map.
- Distinct styling for tectonic plates and earthquake markers.
- Layer controls for toggling the visibility of different data layers.

## Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- D3.js

## Key Findings
(Include a summary of significant insights or patterns observed from the visualizations.)

## Running the Code
